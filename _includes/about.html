            <h2 class="space-bottom2 space-top4">Bridging the Map</h2>
            <p>
              Right next to the old bridge in Heidelberg there lives a curious little statue, - a bronze ape. In its hand, it holds a mirror to remind anyone crossing the bridge to look back from where they came from and remember who they are. For the 2019 SotM in Heidelberg we want to take the role of that little ape and remind everyone that no matter where we are going and what we are doing with OSM, we should never forget that we all come from the same origin a little map that anyone can modify and use. Whether you are a hobby mapper, a scientific researcher, a humanitarian, or a global company, we want to bridge the gap between us, or better yet, we want to Bridge the Map.
